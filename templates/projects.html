    <p>I use the app Strava to track my runs and bike rides. A while back I published a peice on how to access and
        analyze activity data for other Strava users.
        A lot of people reached out and asked if I could do this for them, so I built a web app that allows users to
        authenticate into the Strava and recieve a report
        containing stats and trends for their top activites.
        You can check out the live app by clicking above, or see a
