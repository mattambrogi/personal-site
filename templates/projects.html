            class="project-year">2025</span></h5>
    <p>
        MyCase is a legal practice management platform under the 8am brand. I helped start the AI team which spun out of
        a hackathon team I led. We designed and launched the Case Assistant, a first of its kind general purpose agent
        for case knowledge work. I specifically owned agent architecture, evals, prompting, observability, and the
        overall agentic experience.
        Users can ask it things like:
    <ul>
        <li>"Give me a summary to get up to speed on this case."</li>
        <li>"What work has been done on this case this month and do we have any outstanding tasks?"</li>
        <li>"Draft a letter to client explaining the status of the case."</li>
    </ul>
    It can intelligently access documents, notes, tasks, events, and more. We are expanding into performing longer
    running tasks for users.

        AI coaching and analytics for Strava athletes. Users ask natural language questions about their training data

    <p>I use the app Strava to track my runs and bike rides. A while back I published a peice on how to access and

        A lot of people reached out and asked if I could do this for them, so I built a web app that allows users to
        authenticate into the Strava and recieve a report
        containing stats and trends for their top activites.
        You can check out the live app by clicking above, or see a
