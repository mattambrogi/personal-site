    <h5><a href="https://my-strava-data.herokuapp.com/">Strava Activity Analysis</a></h5>
    <p>I use the app Strava to track my runs and bike rides. A while back I published a peice on how to access and
        analyze activity data for other Strava users.
        A lot of people reached out and asked if I could do this for them, so I built a web app that allows users to
        authenticate into the Strava and recieve a report
        containing stats and trends for their top activites.
        You can check out the live app by clicking above, or see a
        <a href="{% url 'blog_post' 'strava-analysis' %}">demo</a> here.

        and even friends, can use it to get to know each other or
        just fill some time.</p>

    <h5><a href="https://github.com/mattambrogi/job-board-platform">Shopify for Job Boards</a></h5>
    <p>I noticed that a trend of a lot influences and niche leaders hosting job boards. Most were designing and building
        their own from scratch.
        I build an MVP for a web app that would abstract this process and serve as a Shopify for job boards. Pallet has
        since come along and built a really cool business around a more sophisticated execution of this idea.
