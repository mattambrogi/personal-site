    <h2 class="mb-3"> Hey, I'm Matt.</h2>
    <p>I’m a programmer and, previously, a product manager.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of 2022 I left my job to do a batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse
            Center</a>, a self directed retreat for
        engineers. For the past few months I’ve been building web apps, learning new tools and frameworks, studying
        algorithms, and learning from other programmers.
        If you're interested in reading about my experience, you can check
        out <a href="https://mattambrogi.bearblog.dev/">my RC blog</a> which I updated weekly during my batch.</p>
    <p>Before Recurse Center, I was a product manager on Capital One’s machine learning platform.
        My team built tools that enabled data scientists and engineers to experiment with, improve, and deploy models at
        scale.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also did data analysis at Capital One for a while and interned as a product manager at Alarm.com, a smart home
        platform.
        I went to The University of Maryland where I designed my own major called Engineering and Product Management.
        My course work covered math, physics, computer science, mechanical engineering, design, and business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I like to explore outside, skateboard, play guitar, and write.
    </p>
    <p>I host some writing and recent projects on this site. If you'd like to find out more about me,
        you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_ambrogi">Twitter</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/mattambrogi">GitHub</a>,
