    <h2 class="mb-3"> Hey, I'm Matt.</h2>
    <p>I’m an AI Engineer. I'm particularly interested in building agents that help people in their daily lives.</p>
    <p>
        I currently work at MyCase, a legal practice management platform, where I helped start the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.8am.com/ai/">AI team</a>. I designed and launched the Case Assistant — a general purpose
        agent for case
        knowledge work.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also build things on the side: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.caiden.app/">Caiden</a> is an AI coaching
        agent for Strava athletes, and <a target="_blank"
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/palate-custom-ai-podcasts/id6479173263">Palate AI</a> is a mobile app
        that turns articles into audio summaries (launched before Google's NotebookLM).
    </p>
    <p>
        Before that I attended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse Center</a> where I built
        early GPT-3 applications and led an applied ML study group. Prior to that I was a PM on Capital One's machine
        learning platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        I went to the University of Maryland where I designed my own major called Engineering and Product Management.
        My course work consisted of math, physics, computer science, design, and business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of all of that I love to go on adventures outside, skateboard, ride my bike, write, and play music.
        I was lucky enough to take a year off during college to study international development and spend time traveling
        after.
        I’ve spent a month in each of the following countries: China, Laos, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua.
    </p>
    <p>I host some writing and recent projects on this site. If you'd like to find out more about me,
        you can find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/matt_ambrogi">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank"
