    <h2 class="mb-3"> Hey, I'm Matt.</h2>
    <p>I’m an engineer and product manager interesting in building tools with data and machine learning.</p>
    <p>I work as a full stack engineer. In my freetime I am exploring deep learning and building products with LLMs.</p>
    <p>At the start of 2022, I took a break from work to attend <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse
            Center</a>, a self directed retreat for programmers.
        I built web apps, studied machine learning, and learned a lot from other engineers.
        You can read about my experience <a href="https://mattambrogi.bearblog.dev/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Before that I worked at Capital One. I was a part of Capital One’s first cohort of their Product Development
        Program.
        During my first rotation I worked to find actionable insights in customer data.
        During my second rotation I worked as a PM on Capital One’s machine learning platform, where I stayed for a year
        an a half.
        My team built tools that enabled data scientists and engineers to experiment with, improve, and deploy models at
        scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        I went to the University of Maryland where I designed my own major called Engineering and Product Management.
        My course work consisted of math, physics, computer science, design, and business.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of all of that I love to go on adventures outside, skateboard, ride my bike, write, and play music.
        I was lucky enough to take a year off during college and spend time traveling after.
        I’ve spent a month in each of the following countries: China, Laos, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua.
    </p>
