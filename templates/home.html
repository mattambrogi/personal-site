    <h2 class="mb-3"> Hey, I'm Matt.</h2>
    <p>I’m an engineer and product manager.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in deep learning and building products with
        LLMs. Most recently I've been exploring retrieval augmented generation, agents, and fine tuning language models.
    </p>
    <p>Prior to my current work I had the chance to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Participate in Buildspace's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recurse.com/">Nights and Weekends</a>
            during which I researched how to <a
                href="https://www.mattambrogi.com/posts/improve-retrieval-augmented-generation/">improve the performance
                of retrieval augmented generation systems.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Attend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse Center</a> where I built web apps,
            studied machine learning, and learned a lot from other engineers.
            You can read about my experience <a href="https://mattambrogi.bearblog.dev/">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Work as a PM on Capital One's machine learning platform. My team built tools that enabled data scientists
            and engineers to experiment with, improve, and deploy models at
            scale.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I went to the University of Maryland where I designed my own major called Engineering and Product Management.
        My course work consisted of math, physics, computer science, design, and business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of all of that I love to go on adventures outside, skateboard, ride my bike, write, and play music.
        I was lucky enough to take a year off during college and spend time traveling after.
        I’ve spent a month in each of the following countries: China, Laos, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua.
    </p>
    <p>I host some writing and recent projects on this site. If you'd like to find out more about me,
        you can find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/matt_ambrogi">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank"
